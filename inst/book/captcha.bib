  abstract = {Human interaction proofs (HIPs) have become common place on the internet due to their effectiveness in deterring automated abuse of online services intended for humans. However, there is a co-evolutionary arms race in progress and these proofs are becoming more difficult for genuine users while attackers are getting better at breaking existing HIPs. We studied various popular HIPs on the internet to understand their strength and human friendliness. To determine HIP strength, we adopted a direct approach of building computer attacks using image processing and machine learning techniques. To understand human-friendliness, a sequence of users studies were conducted to investigate HIP character recognition by humans under a variety of visual distortions and clutter commonly employed in reading-based HIPs. We found that many of the online HIPs are pure recognition tasks that can be easily broken using machine learning. The stronger HIPs tend to pose a combination of segmentation and recognition challenges. Further, the HIP user studies show that given correct segmentation, computers are much better at HIP character recognition than humans. In light of these results, we propose that segmentation-based reading challenges are the future for building stronger human-friendly HIPs. An example of such a segmentation-based HIP is presented with a preliminary assessment of its strength and human-friendliness.},

  abstract = {HIPs, or Human Interactive Proofs, are challenges meant to be easily solved by humans, while remaining too hard to be economically solved by computers. HIPs are increasingly used to protect services against automatic script attacks. To be effective, a HIP must be difficult enough to discourage script attacks by raising the computation and/or development cost of breaking the HIP to an unprofitable level. At the same time, the HIP must be easy enough to solve in order to not discourage humans from using the service. Early HIP designs have successfully met these criteria [1]. However, the growing sophistication of attackers and correspondingly increasing profit incentives have rendered most of the currently deployed HIPs vulnerable to attack [2,7,12]. Yet, most companies have been reluctant to increase the difficulty of their HIPs for fear of making them too complex or unappealing to humans. The purpose of this study is to find the visual distortions that are most effective at foiling computer attacks without hindering humans. The contribution of this research is that we discovered that 1) automatically generating HIPs by varying particular distortion parameters renders HIPs that are too easy for computer hackers to break, yet humans still have difficulty recognizing them, and 2) it is possible to build segmentation-based HIPs that are extremely difficult and expensive for computers to solve, while remaining relatively easy for humans.},

  abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

  abstract = {Recognizing arbitrary multi-character text in unconstrained natural photographs is a hard problem. In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over \$96\textbackslash\%\$ accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve upon the state-of-the-art, achieving \$97.84\textbackslash\%\$ accuracy. We also evaluate this approach on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing several tens of millions of street number annotations and achieve over \$90\textbackslash\%\$ accuracy. To further explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition tasks, we apply it to synthetic distorted text from reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses distorted text to distinguish humans from bots. We report a \$99.8\textbackslash\%\$ accuracy on the hardest category of reCAPTCHA. Our evaluations on both tasks indicate that at specific operating thresholds, the performance of the proposed system is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of human operators.},

  abstract = {Learning in the positive-unlabeled (PU) setting is prevalent in real world applications. Many previous works depend upon theSelected Completely At Random (SCAR) assumption to utilize unlabeled data, but the SCAR assumption is not often applicable to the real world due to selection bias in label observations. This paper is the first generative PU learning model without the SCAR assumption. Specifically, we derive the PU risk function without the SCAR assumption, and we generate a set of virtual PU examples to train the classifier. Although our PU risk function is more generalizable, the function requires PU instances that do not exist in the observations. Therefore, we introduce the VAE-PU, which is a variant of variational autoencoders to separate two latent variables that generate either features or observation indicators. The separated latent information enables the model to generate virtual PU instances. We test the VAE-PU on benchmark datasets with and without the SCAR assumption. The results indicate that the VAE-PU is superior when selection bias exists, and the VAE-PU is also competent under the SCAR assumption. The results also emphasize that the VAE-PU is effective when there are few positive-labeled instances due to modeling on selection bias.},
